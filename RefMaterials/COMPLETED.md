# Completed Tasks - libDELILA-digitizer

## Project Overview
This document records all successfully completed development tasks for the libDELILA-digitizer library. The project evolved from supporting only PSD firmware to a comprehensive multi-firmware system with automatic decoder selection and improved reliability.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Abstract Decoder Interface (High Priority)
- âœ… Created `include/IDecoder.hpp` with common interface
- âœ… Implemented key methods: `AddData()`, `GetEventData()`, `SetTimeStep()`, `SetDumpFlag()`, `SetModuleNumber()`
- âœ… Added virtual destructor and pure virtual methods
- âœ… Established foundation for polymorphic decoder handling

### 2. Decoder Refactoring (High Priority)
- âœ… **Renamed Dig1Decoder â†’ PSD1Decoder**
  - âœ… Renamed files: `include/Dig1Decoder.hpp` â†’ `include/PSD1Decoder.hpp`
  - âœ… Renamed files: `src/Dig1Decoder.cpp` â†’ `src/PSD1Decoder.cpp`
  - âœ… Updated class name and all references throughout codebase
  - âœ… Made it inherit from `IDecoder` interface
- âœ… **Renamed Dig2Decoder â†’ PSD2Decoder**
  - âœ… Renamed files: `include/Dig2Decoder.hpp` â†’ `include/PSD2Decoder.hpp`
  - âœ… Renamed files: `src/Dig2Decoder.cpp` â†’ `src/PSD2Decoder.cpp`
  - âœ… Updated class name and all references throughout codebase
  - âœ… Made it inherit from `IDecoder` interface

### 3. PSD2Decoder Implementation (High Priority)
- âœ… Fixed PSD2Decoder constructor/destructor naming issues
- âœ… Updated method calls to use correct class names
- âœ… Successfully compiled and tested PSD2Decoder
- âœ… Created `include/PSD2Constants.hpp` - organized PSD2-specific constants
- âœ… Created `include/PSD2Structures.hpp` - organized PSD2 data structures
- âœ… Updated PSD2Decoder to use new constants and structures
- âœ… Verified PSD2Decoder compilation and functionality

### 4. PHA1 Support Implementation (High Priority)
- âœ… Created `include/PHA1Constants.hpp` - PHA1-specific data format constants
- âœ… Created `include/PHA1Decoder.hpp` - PHA1 decoder header (based on PSD1)
- âœ… Created `src/PHA1Decoder.cpp` - PHA1 decoder implementation
- âœ… Implemented PHA1 as minimal modification of PSD1 (since differences are small)
- âœ… Verified PHA1 implementation works correctly

### 5. Digitizer1 Automatic Decoder Selection (High Priority)
- âœ… Changed `fPSD1Decoder` to `fDecoder` of type `std::unique_ptr<IDecoder>`
- âœ… Updated includes to have both `PSD1Decoder.hpp` and `PHA1Decoder.hpp`
- âœ… Implemented automatic decoder selection based on firmware type:
  ```cpp
  if (fDigitizerType == DigitizerType::PSD1) {
      fDecoder = std::make_unique<PSD1Decoder>(fNThreads);
  } else if (fDigitizerType == DigitizerType::PHA1) {
      fDecoder = std::make_unique<PHA1Decoder>(fNThreads);
  }
  ```
- âœ… Updated all references from `fPSD1Decoder` to `fDecoder`
- âœ… Verified automatic selection works with device tree firmware detection

### 6. Build System Updates (High Priority)
- âœ… Added all new source files to build system
- âœ… Removed old Dig1Decoder and Dig2Decoder files from build
- âœ… Updated include paths and dependencies
- âœ… Verified successful compilation of entire project

### 7. Connection Reliability Improvements (Medium Priority)
- âœ… **CAEN_FELib_Open Retry Logic in Digitizer1**: Implemented up to 3 retry attempts with 1-second delays
- âœ… **CAEN_FELib_Open Retry Logic in Digitizer2**: Implemented up to 3 retry attempts with 1-second delays
- âœ… Added proper error logging for each retry attempt
- âœ… Improved connection success rate for intermittent hardware issues

### 8. Performance and Threading Fixes (High Priority)
- âœ… **Fixed CPU Usage Issue in PSD1Decoder**: Eliminated 100% CPU usage during idle periods
- âœ… **Fixed CPU Usage Issue in PSD2Decoder**: Eliminated 100% CPU usage during idle periods  
- âœ… **Fixed CPU Usage Issue in PHA1Decoder**: Eliminated 100% CPU usage during idle periods
- âœ… **Fixed Deadlock Issue**: Resolved deadlock during shutdown by proper mutex handling
- âœ… Restructured decoder threads to sleep outside mutex locks
- âœ… Maintained thread safety while improving performance

### 9. User Control Improvements (Medium Priority)
- âœ… **Removed Automatic StopAcquisition from Destructor**: Gives users full control over start/stop
- âœ… Eliminated double "Stop acquisition" messages
- âœ… Users now have complete control over digitizer lifecycle

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture Improvements
- **Unified Interface**: All decoders implement the same `IDecoder` interface
- **Automatic Selection**: Firmware type detection from device tree `fwtype` parameter
- **Clean Separation**: Separate constants and structures files for each decoder type
- **Polymorphic Design**: Runtime decoder selection based on hardware capabilities

### Reliability Enhancements
- **Connection Retry Logic**: Handles intermittent hardware connection issues
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Proper mutex handling prevents shutdown hangs
- **Resource Management**: Efficient CPU usage and memory management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and recovery

### Firmware Support Matrix
- **PSD1**: Pulse Shape Discrimination firmware for older digitizers (Digitizer1)
- **PSD2**: Pulse Shape Discrimination firmware for newer digitizers (Digitizer2)
- **PHA1**: Pulse Height Analysis firmware for older digitizers (Digitizer1)
- **Automatic Detection**: Based on device tree firmware type detection

## Project Status
**Status: All planned tasks completed successfully! ðŸŽ‰**

The libDELILA-digitizer library now provides:
- Multi-firmware support with automatic selection
- Improved reliability and performance
- Clean, maintainable architecture
- Full user control over digitizer operations
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Notes
- PHA2 firmware does not exist - only PHA1 is available for Digitizer1
- All decoders maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
- The system is designed for reliable long-term operation
- Firmware type detection is automatic and transparent to users
