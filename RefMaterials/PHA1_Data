As same as PSD1, The fetched data has multiple Board aggregate block.

Board block aggregate header (4 words)
First word
bit[0:27] = Board aggregate size in 32-bit words
bit[28: 31] = 0b1010
Second word
bit[0:7] = Dual channel mask. if bit1 is set, the pair of ch0 and ch1. if bit2 is set, the pair of ch2 and ch3, etc.
bit[8:22] = Pattern of LVDS
bit[26] = board fail flag
bit[27:31] = Board ID
Third word
bit[0:22] = Board aggregate counter
Fourth word
bit[0:31] = Board aggregate time tag.

If Dual channel mask is 0b110, the first Dual channel block is for ch2 and ch3, the second Dual channel block is for ch4 and ch5.
Dual channel block aggregate header (2 words)
First word
bit[0:30] = Dual channel aggregate size in 32-bit words
bit[31] if 1, the second word is the Format Info
Second word
bit[0:15] = Number of samles in the waveform / 8. If this is 0, the waveform is not present. NUM SAMPLES WAVE/8 corresponds to the number of words to be read in the event related to the waveform /4 (2 samples per word)
bit[16:19] = DP: Digital Virtual Probe selection among:
0000 = “Peaking”: shows where the energy is calculated
0001 = “Armed”: digital input showing where the RC‐CR2 crosses the Threshold
0010 = “Peak Run”: starts with the trigger and last for the whole event (see [RD2])
0011 = “Pile‐Up”: shows when there is a pile‐up event and corresponds to the time interval when the energy
calculation is disabled due to the pile‐up event
0100 = “Peaking”: shows where the energy is calculated
0101 = “Trg Validation Win”: digital input showing the trigger validation acceptance window TVAW (refer
to [RD3])
0110 = “BSL Freeze”: shows where the trapezoid baseline is frozen for the energy calculation
0111 = “TRG Holdoff”: shows the trigger hold‐off parameter
1000 = “Trg Validation”: shows the trigger validation signal TRG_VAL (refer to chapter and [RD3])
1001 = “Acq Busy”, this is 1 when the board is busy (saturated input signal or full memory board) or there
is a veto
UM5678 ‐ 725‐730 DPP‐PHA User Manual rev. 3 107
1010 = “TRG Window”: shows the RT Discrimination Width
1011 = “Ext TRG”, shows the external trigger, when available
1100 = “Busy”, shows when the memory board is full.

bit[20:21] = AP2: Analog Probe 2 Selection. AP2 can be selected among:
00 = “Input”: the input signal from pre‐amplified detectors
01 = “Threshold”: the RC‐CR2 threshold value
10 = “Trapezoid‐BL”: the trapezoid shape minus its baseline
11 = “Baseline”: displays the trapezoid baselin

bit[22:23] = AP1: Analog Probe 1 Selection. AP1 can be selected among:
00 = “Input”: the input signal from pre‐amplified detectors
01 = “RC‐CR”: first step of the trigger and timing filter
10 = “RC‐CR2”: second step of the trigger and timing filter
11 = “Trapezoid”: trapezoid resulting from the energy filt

bit[24:26] = EX: Extra option. Usually use 0b010
EX: Extras option enabled flag:
000 = the word “EXTRAS 2” will be read as:
[31 : 16] = Extended Time Stamp: those 16 bits can be added (most significant bits) to the Time Stamp
representation, which becomes a 31+16=47 bit number;
[15 : 0] = The trapezoid baseline value * 4.
100 = the word “EXTRAS 2” will be read as:
[31 : 16] = Lost Trigger Counter;
[15 : 0] = Total Trigger Counter.
001 = Reserved;
010 = the word “EXTRAS 2” will be read as:
[31 : 16] = Extended Time Stamp: those 16 bits can be added (most significant bits) to the Time Stamp
representation, which becomes a 31+16=47 bit number;
[15 : 10] = Reserved;
[9 : 0] = Fine Time Stamp (linear interpolation of the RC‐CR2 signal between the events before and
after the zero crossing);
011 = Reserved;
100 = the word “EXTRAS 2” will be read as:
[31 : 16] = Lost Trigger Counter;
[15 : 0] = Total Trigger Counter;
101 = the word “EXTRAS 2” will be read as:
[31 : 16] = Event Before the Zero Crossing;
[15 : 0] = Event After the Zero Crossing;
111 = Reserved.
bit[31] = DT: Dual trace enabled flag (1 = enabled, 0 = disabled)
bit[30] = EE: Energy enabled flag: Must be 1
bit[29] = ET: Time Tag enabled flag, must be 1
bit[28] = E2: Extras 2 enabled flag
bit[27] = ES: Waveform (samples) enabled flag

After header, events block
First word
bit[0:30] = Trigger time tag
bit[31] = showing channel number of pair. 0 is even channel, 1 is odd channel
If Num samples Wave/8 is not 0, the next words are waveform data. Lower bit signal is the first sample, higher bit signal is the second sample. If DT flag is set, the first sample is AP1 and the second sample is AP2, and so on.
bit[0:13] = Analog Probe data.
bit[14] = Digital Probe 
bit[15] = Tn: bit identifying in which sample the Trigger occurred
bit[16:29] = Analog Probe data
bit[30] = Digital Probe 
bit[31] = Tn: bit identifying in which sample the Trigger occurred

DPim (i=1, 2; m=0, 1, …,n‐1): Digital Virtual Probe value i for sample m. DP1m is the value of the probe written
Sm (m = 0, 2, 4… n‐2): Even Samples of AP1 at time t = m
Sm′ (m′ = 1, 3, 4… n‐1): if DT=0, then Sm′ corresponds to the odd Samples of AP1 at time t = m′. Otherwise, if
DT=1, they correspond to even Samples of AP2 at time t = m′ – 1
Second word
bit[0:31] = Extras 2. In our case, usually Extra option == 0b010, bit[0:9] = fine time stamp, bit[10:15] = nothing, bit[16:31] = extended time stamp.
Third word
bit[0:14] = Energy
bit[15] = Pile up flag
bit[16:25] = Extra
